## FAQ:

Q: Do I need to install this on both server and client?\
A: Yes.

Q: My players are getting kicked from the server with weird error messages when they try to join.\
A: Ask them if they have this mod installed. If not, they won't be able to join the server.

## Usage

For quest creators:\
Simply follow the steps you would normally take to create a quest, but select the cobblemon category. Example images can
be found in the [gallery](https://modrinth.com/mod/cobblemon-quests/gallery).

For players:\
Just play the game as you normally would and look at the quests you have. It's all pretty self-explanatory.
