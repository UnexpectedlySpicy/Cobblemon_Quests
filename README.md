## FAQ:

Q: Do I need to install this on both server and client?\
A: Yes.

Q: No quests are showing up in the quest book. What do I do?\
A: This mod does not add any quests by itself. It allows quest creators to create cobblemon related quests.

## Usage

For players:\
Just play the game as you normally would and look at the quests you have. It should be fairly self-explanatory.
